### Processes
- address size of a 32 bit process = 4 bytes
- address size of a 64 bit process = 8 bytes

---
### Imp:
- word = 2 bytes, 2 bytes
- DWord = 4 bytes, 4 bytes
- QWord = 8 bytes, 8 bytes
---

### Shellcode
- assembly code with specific purpose
- used to avoid detection

### Windows API
- libraries by this api ARE THE .DLL FILES
- custom type definitions (eg. dword,qword)
- refer Microsoft documentation
- Structs: in C is a custom container that group a certain kind of data


## Injection Attacks
- file based attack
- inject some malicious code in a process itself
	1. Allocate Memory
	2. Write shellcode in that memory
	3. Execute shellcode
- #include <windows.h> = windows header that includes almost all headers for all win api
