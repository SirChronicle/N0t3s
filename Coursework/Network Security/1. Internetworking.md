IDK
- traceroute utility
- how to protect integrity of a packet (HMAC)
- Counter Mode, ECB and CBC encryption
- IND-CPA, OAEP, DNSSEC, DKIM


- ARPANET had 19 nodes

## Internet Protocol
- Scalability: interconnect a large number of heterogenous networks
- Concatenation of networks: IETF Process
- Protocol Stack with the IP as focal point (can connect to anything)
- Exception:
	- not always clean and simple
	- Overlay networks; Eg. VPN(IPSec/TLS), Multicast
		- Tunneling
		- Generic Routing Encapsulation(GRE), IP in IP
- IP header : meta data
- IP service Model:
	- to keep routers simple and scalable: IP is **connectionless**(datagram based) and **best-effort delivery**(unreliable) [like UDP?]

- Fragmentation and Reassembly
	- each network/link has some MTU (Maximum Transmit Unit)
	- Strategy
