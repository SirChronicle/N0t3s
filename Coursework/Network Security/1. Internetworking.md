- traceroute utility
- how to protect integrity of a packet (HMAC)
- Counter Mode, ECB and CBC encryption
- IND-CPA, OAEP, DNSSEC, DKIM


- ARPANET had 19 nodes

## Lesson 1 : Internet Protocol
- Scalability: interconnect a large number of heterogenous networks
- Concatenation of networks: IETF Process
- Protocol Stack with the IP as focal point (can connect to anything)
- Exception:
	- not always clean and simple
	- Overlay networks; Eg. VPN(IPSec/TLS), Multicast
		- Tunneling
		- Generic Routing Encapsulation(GRE), IP in IP
- IP header : meta data
- IP service Model:
	- to keep routers simple and scalable: IP is **connectionless**(datagram based) and **best-effort delivery**(unreliable) [like UDP?]

- Fragmentation and Reassembly
	- each network/link has some MTU (Maximum Transmit Unit)
	- Strategy

## Lesson 2 : IP Addressing

- unique abt IP addr = helps (router) identify grps and individual hosts
- exception to uniqueness : multicasting (anyone can join)
- private ip class for ipv4
	- A(10.0.0.0) \network^ ; /hosts^^
	- B |network ; |hosts
	- C(192.168.0.0) /network ; \hosts (household)
	- loopback
- CIDR
	- Subnetting
	- Supernetting

- Subnet num to mask
	- 128.96.34.129
	- 10000000.01100000.00100010.10000001
	-& 11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000
	-= 128.96.34.128

- how to know what is the next hop
	- for interface: destination is .......?
	- for router: destination is MAC addr of Router(eg.R2)

## Lesson 3 : IP over LAN

- to know the MAC addr of the next hop =  ARP 
- ARP  is address resolution protocol
- design of ARP:

	``` 
	IP
	| \.
	|  ARP
	|./ 
	ETH
	```
	- maintains a table of IP to physical addr:
		- broadcast req if IP not in table
		- target machine responds with physical addr
		- tabe entries are discarded if not refreshed

### ICMP
- ICMP does **not** have a port

	```
	   ICMP	
          /  
	IP
	| \.
	|  ARP
	|./ 
	ETH
	```
- how does ping work?
	- src sends a small echo msg and gets back the requested ICMP msg enclosed in an IP with different process ID
- how does traceroute utility work?
- 1 flag in ip header, you can set if fragmentaion should be done or not, and if you set it as "not fragent" and fragmentation is required than the reply would be an ICMP msg saying fragmentation required.

### DHCP
- where does it sit on the ip table

	```
		DHCP
	       /	
	    UDP    ICMP	
	       \  /  
		IP
		| \.
		|  ARP
		|./ 
		ETH
	```
## Lesson 4 : Routing Overview
- Distance Vector : tell everything you know to your neighbours (so that everyone can calc their own distance to any node)
	- (destination, cost, nexthop) : triples every node has
	- exchange goes periodically
	- loops:
		```
		A-----B-----C
		   <--
		   (A,1)
		   (C,1)
		-->
		(B,1)
		(C,2)

		but,

		A-----B--x--C		
		   <--
		   (A,1)
		   (C,3) //wrong, inf loop occurred	
		```		

- Link State protocols : tells everything to everyone

### BGP-4 : Border Gateway Protocol

### IP Version 6
- Features
	- 128-bit addresses (classless)
	- multicast
	- real-time service
	- authentication and security
	- autoconfiguration
	- mobility
	- end-to-end fragmentation
	- protocol extensions
- 

---
Note:
multicast vs anycast
	- multicast is grp which anyone can join and anyone in that grp will receive a msg when broadcasted
	- in anycast the packet will only go to one node
