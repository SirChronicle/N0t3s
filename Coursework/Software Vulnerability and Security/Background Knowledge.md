- intel x86
- x86-64, aka amd 64
- ARM Cortex-A/M
- Linux

- Pwngdb

# Background Knowledge

## Compiler, Linker, Loader
- you can only run things in memory
- A shell in a nutshell
	- start will calling 'fork'
	- parent and child have same code
- to load and exec a bin program in Linux it performs a lot of checks
- so : .o is object library and .so is basically static library object
- loading binary in virtual address space : binary to RAM but RAM has memory management unit,  32 bit = 4GB, this is virtual  

- #define : how macro start
- add a b : these are 3 variables in command line = add;a;b

## x86 Architecture
- Little Endian : least significant byte is stored at lowest addr (intel,ARM)
- Big Endian : is stored highest addr

###general purpose registers
	- 8 general purpose registers
		- EAX
		- EBX
		- ECX
		- EDX
		- ESI: source index
		- EDI: source destination
	- ESP
	- EBP
- when we say 64 bit cpu it means most are 64 bit but some can be as much as 512 bit

- Instruction form = label: mnemonic operand1, operand2, operand3,....operand n
	- eg: hlt (0 operand)
	- inc (1 op); inc <reg>, inc <mem>
	- add (2 op); add <reg>,<reg>
	- imul (1-3 op); imul <reg32>,<reg32>,<con>
- [eax] : memory
- eax : register
- CL is 1 byte
- push/pop
- is ESP related to ESP32 microcontrollers?
- no complex instructions:
	- like (ebx+4)*esi cannot be done, 2 instructions are needed:
		- ebx+4 = h
		- h*esi
- Control flow instructions
	- jmp
	- jcondition
	- cmp
	- call
	- ret

## Linux File Permmissions
- groups	
	- owner
	- group
	- others
- types
	- read
	- write
	- execute
- 

## Set-UID Programs
- user ids
	- Real ID
	- Effective ID
	- Saved ID

- strace ls (what system calls are made when done ls?)
- man (manual) sections
- XOR with same number gives 0 : xor eax eax (this sets eax to 0)
- in Linux any number of slashes(/,//,////,///////..) means 1 slash (/) **[can later work as padding]**
- till system calls
